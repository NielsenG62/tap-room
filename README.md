## Description

_This is a React app that tracks kegs. When a user clicks to add a keg, they will be asked for information about the keg. The keg is then added to the list to be tracked. A user can then click on the keg tab to see all it's information, or press the button to pour a pint. This will decrease that pints left count. This is solely a front end project, so there is no storage of information and it will get lost on a page refresh._
